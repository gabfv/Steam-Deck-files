Just a simple collection of various files deployed on a Steam Deck.

# Apex Deck (Switching|Remoting) Tool Ultra+ Mk9000

This is just two simple scripts that allows remoting and/or switching to the desktop mode.

- The **Switching Tool** is used to switch to Desktop mode when the Deck is in Big Picture mode (or gaming mode). Note that the script will just run once and exit imemdiately after.
- The **Remoting Tool** is used to remote into the Deck by opening up a Konsole (terminal) window on the Deck. Note that you need to keep it open since closing it will terminate the remote session.

## Post-deployment configuration

You also need to right-click on the two tools to "Add to Steam". Furthermore, you can also disable the overlay, specially with the **Remoting Tool** since it will output error messages in the terminal occasionally if the overlay is left enabled. It doesn't really appears to hinder how the terminal works but it does make your workflow harder to read, since error messages will sporadically be outputted in the terminal's window.
